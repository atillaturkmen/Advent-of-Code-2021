# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles throughout December. This repository contains my solutions to these puzzles, implemented in C++.

Advent of code website: https://adventofcode.com/2021

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, you will need a C++ compiler. Here's how to compile and execute the code:

```bash
g++ -o dayX dayX.cpp
./dayX
```
Replace dayX with the specific day's code you want to run.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies for these solutions. They are written in standard C++.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the creators of Advent of Code for providing these fun challenges.
